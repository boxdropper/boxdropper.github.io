        <font size="4.5" color="white">This is the first entry of the SYLENTH personal blog, here i will ramble and you will read all of it because your curiosity has gotten the better of you.<br>
        Although you should really learn to fight that curiosity as it can very well get you killed one day.
        <br>

        For a quick introduction, I'm Sylenth, I am a random british guy currently studying game design with too much free time and very little life outside of the internet,<br>
        loath as I am to admit that.
        <br>
        <br>
        I started this whole redesign of my website in the Summer of 2024 after taking a good long look at the old design and deciding that I can do better, especially without<br>
        using a template, and so I got to work, took me a while, but I got the first three pages done for the website, leaving the blog until I could get some entries in.
        <br>

        That's all for now, but until then, frog blast the vent core!</font>
